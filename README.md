## This is a social networking site that just has me.

### https://coletterbox.github.io/Social-Network-with-Just-Me-on-It/

Usually when people are asked something like, "Do you have Instagram?" and the answer is no, they can at least say, "No, but I have Facebook." All I can say is, "No." It sounds like I'm lying and/or being anti-social.

I have considered reactivating Facebook or creating an Instagram account because of this, but I really, really don't want to.

I am creating my own social networking site right here, and it will just have me on it. You may see it, if you like, and you may even be my internet friend in spirit, but you cannot add me, and that is okay.

You may contact me directly, physically see me and speak to me in person. You may even end up thinking, "Wow, this is almost as good as if it said we were friends on social media."

### Coming soon: A "social networking site" that is a list of people who don't have any social media.
